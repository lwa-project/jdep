# jdep
jdep (Jovian Decametric Emission Probability) is a Python wrapper around Figure 1
of [Zarka et al. (2018, A&A, 618, A84)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/10/aa33586-18/aa33586-18.html)
that is designed to make it easier to find when Jupiter might be emission below
40 MHz and determine which emission regions (Io or non-Io) are likely.
